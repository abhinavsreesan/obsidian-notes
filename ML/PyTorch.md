### What is PyTorch?

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework.

### What can PyTorch be used for?

PyTorch allows you to manipulate and process data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.

## Who uses PyTorch?[Â¶](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/#who-uses-pytorch)

Many of the worlds largest technology companies such as [Meta (Facebook)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/), Tesla and Microsoft as well as artificial intelligence research companies such as [OpenAI use PyTorch](https://openai.com/blog/openai-pytorch/) to power research and bring machine learning to their products.

For example, Andrej Karpathy (head of AI at Tesla) has given several talks ([PyTorch DevCon 2019](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE), [Tesla AI Day 2021](https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=2904)) about how Tesla use PyTorch to power their self-driving computer vision models.

PyTorch is also used in other industries such as argiculture to [power computer vision on tractors](https://medium.com/pytorch/ai-for-ag-production-machine-learning-for-agriculture-e8cfdb9849a1).

### Getting Started
- We can use Google Colab to get started with Pytorch

```python
import torch
torch.__version__
```
